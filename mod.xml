This mod is aimed at making the player owned Needlefish a little more fun and useful, they now have limited RADAR
systems built in (Nobody will build a warship without a Radar!)

Your Needlefish can now provide intel on incoming threats and if you are careful they can even press attacks against
ships by themselves.

* CIWS Needlefish can detect hostile aircraft at 5km
* Torpedo Needlefish can detect ships at 3.5km
* Cruise Missile Needlefish can detect ships at 6km
* Gun Needlefish can detect ships at 2km

All Needlefish can see ships and aircraft that are closer than 0.5km.

This is merged with 2 other mods:

Albatross AWACS swaps the AWACS-carrying capability from the Manta to the Albatross - By Thumblegudget
Also includes UI enhancer - By QuantX
